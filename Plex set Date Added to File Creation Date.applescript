-- this script goes through two steps:
-- step 1. for a given range of Plex directory id's, finds all files in those folders, and sets the added_at date for each file to its file creation time ("btime")
-- note: this for songs, movies, tv episodes, etc
-- step 2. sets the added_at value of the albums of those songs to the added_at of its first track
-- note: this only for music albums
